Final Project instructions

A. Create an abstract class named Rental. 
Must have instance variables: newModel type boolean, rentalCost type double, and rentalNumber type long int. All must be private.

It also must include the following member functions:

1. equals() which returns true if two Rental objects have the same rentalNumber.

2. all of the appropriate get/set methods for each of the above member variables. Make sure to have data validation done on the set methods to prevent invalid/illegal values from being passed into the member variables. (Example: rentalCost should not be allowed to be negative).

3. include an abstract method named lateCharge, that will only be implemented in child classes that inherit the Rental class.

B. Create 3 subclass to inherit Rental class: Ski, Snowboard, SnowMobile

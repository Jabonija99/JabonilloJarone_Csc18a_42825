//Chapter 9 Exercise 14
/*
1) Create an employee superclass that contains 
instance var, methods, & constructor

Include:
    first name
    last name
    social #
    get statements
    a portion of method toString

2) Rewrite ComissionEmployee class(Section 9.4.5) as a subclass of Employee

Notes:
    Class should only contain the instance variables 
        and methods that are not declared in superclass
    Should involed class Employee's constructor
    This toString method should invoke superclass toString

3) Once finished, run the CommissionEmployeeTest (pg 362) to test
